## About Me

Hello! I'm Bezalel, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for learning and teaching. I thrive on solving complex problems and staying ahead of the latest trends in network security and vulnerability assessments. When I'm not immersed in the digital world, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through practical training and mentoring others in the field. I also enjoy learning about new concepts in the world of IT.

Whether I'm working on a new project, playing Football Manager, or celebrating special moments with my family, I bring enthusiasm and dedication to everything I do.

Join me on my journey as I continue to explore the fascinating world of cybersecurity and IT in general.
