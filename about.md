## About Me

Hello! I'm Bezalel, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for learning. I thrive on solving complex problems and staying ahead of the latest trends in network security and vulnerability assessments. When I'm not immersed in the digital world, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through practical training and mentoring others in the field. I also enjoy learning about new concepts in the world of IT.

I am grounded in the basics of penetration testing, as well as security monitoring and network analysis. I am also proficient in memory forensics, analyzing memory dumps to gather artefacts and potential IOCs. I enjoy using Wireshark to monitor and analyze network data in realtime as well as captured to understand the actions carried out on the network.

I am very analytical, with a keen eye for detail. I am looking to expand my knowledge base to the cloud industry.

I also enjoy solving challenges and closing alerts on the popular cyber security platform, LetsDefend. I also extensively use TryHackMe and HackTheBox to hone my skills and learn new things in the security industry.

Whether I'm working on a new project, playing Football Manager, or celebrating special moments with my family, I bring enthusiasm and dedication to everything I do.

Join me on my journey as I continue to explore the fascinating world of cybersecurity and IT in general.
